  C++ is widely used programming language.
  You can use this repository to get yourself familiarized with Basics of C++ programming language.
  Here, MinGW compiler is used on Codelite software.
  Both of these softwares are OpenSource Softwares and you can download these from the below given links:
  Software: CodeLite : https://downloads.codelite.org/
  Compiler : MinGW : https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/
  
  You can use other softwares such as Eclipse, Microsoft Visual Studio, NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.
  
  Once you are ready with the installation, refer to folders in the below given order:
